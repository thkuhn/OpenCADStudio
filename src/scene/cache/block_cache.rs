// Block-definition tessellation cache.
//
// Each block record is tessellated once into block-local coordinates and
// stored as a list of `LocalSub` (either a tessellated primitive wire OR
// an unexpanded reference to a nested INSERT). At Insert use-time we walk
// the defn, transform-copy primitives, and recurse into nested references —
// each nested defn is itself a cache hit, never re-tessellated.
//
// This shape (lazy nested expansion) is essential: a single block like
// `xref-PLANKOTE` can hold ~4700 nested INSERTs, so build-time inlining
// produces a combinatorial blowup. Storing references and expanding on
// demand keeps build work proportional to total entity count.
//
// Cycle detection: at expand-time we maintain a recursion-depth limit and
// a visited set so a self-referential block produces a marker rather than
// recursing forever.
